###最小表现力原则

writing code that expresses my thinking about the problem domain
principle of least expressiveness (PLE)
PLE to reveal my thinking about the problem domain 
ambiguity stops at the code
flawed ideas 有缺陷的想法

least expressive model() that result in a natural program
with the caveat not to contort the code 
in the rule of least power
